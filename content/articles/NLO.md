From [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_programming)
> In mathematics, nonlinear programming is the process of solving an optimization
> problem where some of the constraints or the objective function are nonlinear.
> An optimization problem is one of calculation of the extrema
> (maxima, minima or stationary points) of an objective function over a set of
> unknown real variables and conditional to the satisfaction of a system of
> equalities and inequalities, collectively termed constraints.
